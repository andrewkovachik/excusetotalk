# Excuse to Talk


## What is an Excuse to Talk
An excuse to talk is ran by two friends, Andrew and Jared, and exists purely as a reason for them to have conversations. Feel free to listen along to their random ramblings.

### Episode 1

In an attempt to learn about recording audio and putting it on a website, Andrew recorded his friends while talking about a poem by Edgar Allen Poe, The Raven. As this was a trial to figure out all the different components of recording and uploading the audio quality was not perfect and on occassions maxed out the recorder.

<div class="ready-player-raven player-with-download">

        <source src="edgarallenpoe.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>

<script src="green-audio-player.js">

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        GreenAudioPlayer.init({
            selector: '.player',
            stopOthersOnPlay: true
        });

        GreenAudioPlayer.init({
            selector: '.player-with-download',
            stopOthersOnPlay: true,
            showDownloadButton: true,
            enableKeystrokes: true
        });
